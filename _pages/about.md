Jeongbae Choi is a PhD candidate at the School of Information Studies, [Syracuse University](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeongbae-choi/).

I advocate for a comprehensive and in-depth examination of the philosophical and meta-theoretical foundations of information science, encompassing the philosophy of information, science, technology, and the integration of educational and practice theories. This approach aims to propel the field forward.

My research delves into critical and profound questions in information science. Key focus areas include, but are not limited to, fundamental conceptions in information science, research methodologies, information literacy, information pathology, library education, historical librarianship, information policy, smart cities, critical data science, and the impact of emerging technologies. I have presented at conferences within the fields of information science, library and information science (LIS), and information systems (IS).
(See more at my [Publications page](https://jeongbaechoi.github.io/publications/).)

For my dissertation study, I focus on developing an alternative and comprehensive information literacy framework and curriculum based on realist approaches, through the integration of critical realism in the philosophy of science, social realism in curriculum studies, and the capability approach in political economics. 

Future research topics include: LIS as applied science, learning theories for information literacy, reformulating the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, and critical studies on artificial intelligence.

I hold bachelor’s and master’s degrees in sociology from Seoul National University, South Korea, and have professional experience as a social sciences librarian at SungKyunKwan University.
