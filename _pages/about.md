I am a Ph.D. student at [Syracuse University iSchool](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeongbae-choi/) (School of Information Studies).

My research has focused on (a) philosophy of information, (b) information literacy and library education, (c) information pathologies, and (d) information policy and smart cities.

My particular area of interest involves applying scientific realism (SR) and critical realism (CR) to information science and library and information science (LIS).

I have presented at conferences within the fields of information science, library and information science (LIS), and information systems (IS).
