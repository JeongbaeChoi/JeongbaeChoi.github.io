I am a Ph.D. student at [Syracuse University iSchool](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeongbae-choi/) (School of Information Studies).

My research has focused on (a) philosophy of information, (b) information literacy and library education, (c) information pathologies, and (d) information policy and smart cities. 

I have particularly worked on applying scientific realism (SR) and critical realism (CR) into information science and library and information science (LIS). 

I have [published](https://jeongbaechoi.github.io/publications/) in information science, library and information science (LIS), and information systems (IS) conferences and journals.
