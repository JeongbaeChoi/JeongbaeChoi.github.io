I am a Ph.D. student at [Syracuse University iSchool](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeongbae-choi/), or School of Information Studies.

My research has focused on (a) philosophy of information, (b) information literacy, (c) future librarianship and library education, and (d) information policy and smart cities. 

I have particularly worked on applying scientific realism and critical realism into information science and library and information science (LIS). (See this [blog post](https://jeongbaechoi.github.io/posts/2022/09/info-real/).) 

I have [published](https://jeongbaechoi.github.io/publications/) in information science, library and information science (LIS), and information systems (IS) conferences and journals.
