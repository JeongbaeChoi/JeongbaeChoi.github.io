- **Abstract**

The rapid growth and expansion of information literacy (IL) research and practice notwithstanding, IL continues to suffer from challenges in integrating diverse approaches and findings from both LIS and other disciplines. Against this backdrop, this poster will give an overview of the recent development in information literacy over the last decade (from 2013 to 2022). The review will highlight the following aspects: (a) new topics receiving overall attention (b) the relationships between information literacy and other "literacies", (c) the interdisciplinary characteristics of IL, and (d) the relationships between (socio-technical) conditions and agency (i.e., learners and users). To this end, the author conducted a scoping literature review using the Web of Science database. Some suggestions for future research will be suggested based on the findings identified from the review.Learning OutcomesWhat are the relationships between IL in general and IL in specific domains? How do the researchers address the interdisciplinarity of IL? How do (socio-technical) conditions and agency (i.e., learners and users) interact?
